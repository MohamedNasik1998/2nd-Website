   <p>Virat Kohli, born on November 5, 1988, in Delhi, India, has etched his name as one of the modern era's cricketing legends. Known for his aggressive yet technically sound batting, Kohli made his debut for the Indian cricket team in 2008 and swiftly rose through the ranks. His remarkable consistency across all formats, especially in One Day Internationals (ODIs), Test matches, and Twenty20 internationals, has established him as one of the world's premier batsmen. Kohli's leadership skills came to the fore when he took over the Test captaincy from MS Dhoni in 2014 and later assumed the role of captain across all formats in 2017. Under his captaincy, India achieved significant milestones, including the historic Test series win in Australia during the 2018-2019 season.</p>
    <p>Off the field, Virat Kohli is a charismatic figure who transcends cricket. His marriage to Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma added a touch of glamor to his public persona. The couple welcomed their daughter, Vamika, further cementing Kohli's status as a prominent personality beyond the cricketing arena. Despite the ups and downs in his career, Kohli's unwavering dedication to the sport and his team has left an indelible mark on the cricketing world, making him a cricketing icon and a source of inspiration for aspiring players globally.</p>
